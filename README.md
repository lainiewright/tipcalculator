## Notes

This was the first iOS app that I created. First, I had to buy a MacBook. After that, I did the official iOS App tutorial with Swift (https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/). This helped me eliminate challenges and familiarize myself with all of the components of building an app. My biggest challenge was designing the layout (especially one that is responsive), including animating view components.
